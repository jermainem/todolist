# Simple Todo App

This is a simple Todo application built with ReactJS. It serves as a basic project to refresh and strengthen my React skills before diving into more complex applications again. The app allows users to add, delete, and edit tasks.

# Features

Edit a todo
Delete a todo
View a list of all todos
